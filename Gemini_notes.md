# Summary of Website Changes

This document summarizes all the visual and structural enhancements made to the HydroCav website during our session.

---

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Logo Integration**:
    *   Replaced the text-based "HydroCav" in the navigation bar with the official `HydroCav_Logo.PNG` image.
    *   Created an `assets/images/` directory to properly store the logo file.

2.  **Navigation Bar Redesign**:
    *   **Frosted Glass Effect**: Transformed the navigation bar into a modern, semi-transparent element with a `backdrop-blur` to create a frosted glass look that allows content to be seen behind it.
    *   **Increased Height**: Adjusted the height of the navigation bar to properly accommodate the larger logo, ensuring it no longer overlaps with the content below.
    *   **Centered & Styled Menu**: Centered the main menu links (`Advantages`, `How It Works`, `Contact`) and increased their font size and weight to make them more prominent and visually appealing.

3.  **"Simple Process" Section Overhaul**:
    *   **3D Bubble Numbers**: Replaced the static, numbered circles with new 3D, bubble-like elements that match the website's animated bubble theme, while keeping the numbers clearly visible.
    *   **Liquid Glass Cards**: Applied the `liquid-glass-card` style to the three process steps, unifying the design with the rest of the page.

4.  **"Advantages" Section Enhancements**:
    *   **Centered & Enlarged Icons**: Centered the SVG icons within each advantage card and increased their size by 50% to make them more impactful.

5.  **Contact Form Polish**:
    *   **Liquid Glass Background**: Wrapped the entire contact form in a `liquid-glass-card`, giving it a cohesive, modern look that matches the rest of the site's theme.
