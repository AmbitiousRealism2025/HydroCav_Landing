## üîç **Verification & Testing**

### **DNS Propagation Checking**
Use these tools to check if changes have propagated:
- **WhatsMyDNS.net:** https://www.whatsmydns.net
- **DNS Checker:** https://dnschecker.org
- **Command Line:** `nslookup yourdomain.com`

### **Website Testing Checklist**
Once your domain is connected:
- [ ] **Main Domain:** yourdomain.com loads your website
- [ ] **WWW Subdomain:** www.yourdomain.com also works  
- [ ] **HTTPS/SSL:** Secure connection working
- [ ] **Contact Form:** Still submitting to Supabase correctly
- [ ] **Admin Access:** Footer logo click still works for admin.html
- [ ] **All Features:** Liquid glass effects and animations working

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

### **SSL Certificate**
- **Hostinger:** Usually provides free SSL certificates
- **Setup:** May need to enable SSL for your new domain
- **Verification:** Ensure https:// works after domain connection

### **Email Services**
- **If using GoDaddy Email:** Method 2 (DNS records) preserves email
- **If switching to Hostinger:** Method 1 is simpler, but configure email separately
- **No Email:** Either method works fine

### **Backup Plan**
- **Keep temporary URL:** Don't delete it until domain is 100% working
- **Test thoroughly:** Verify all functionality before announcing new domain
- **Have rollback:** Know how to revert changes if needed

## üìû **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Domain Not Loading**
- **Check propagation:** DNS changes can take 24-48 hours
- **Clear cache:** Clear browser cache and try incognito mode
- **Check name servers:** Verify they're pointing to Hostinger

### **Website Shows Different Content**
- **Check domain configuration:** Ensure domain points to correct directory
- **File permissions:** Verify file permissions are correct
- **Cache issues:** May be serving cached version

### **SSL/HTTPS Issues**  
- **Enable SSL in Hostinger:** Look for SSL certificate settings
- **Force HTTPS:** Configure redirects if needed
- **Mixed content:** Ensure all resources load over HTTPS

## üìã **Post-Setup Tasks**

### **Once Domain is Working:**
- [ ] **Update Supabase settings** if domain restrictions exist
- [ ] **Update any hardcoded URLs** in your code
- [ ] **Set up email forwarding** if needed
- [ ] **Configure analytics** for new domain
- [ ] **Update business listings** with new URL
- [ ] **Test all functionality** thoroughly

### **SEO Considerations:**
