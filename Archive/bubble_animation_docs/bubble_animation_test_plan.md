# Bubble Animation Test Plan

## Objective
Verify that the bubble animations work correctly after removing the debugging styles from the CSS.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Bubble Appearance
- [ ] Bubbles appear in all three sections (hero, advantages, CTA)
- [ ] Bubbles have proper 3D glass effects
- [ ] Bubbles have correct color schemes based on background
- [ ] Bubbles have varied sizes (xl, lg, md, sm, xs)

### 2. Animation Functionality
- [ ] Bubbles float upward with drift patterns
- [ ] Animations have different speeds (very-slow, slow, medium, fast, very-fast)
- [ ] Bubbles fade in at the bottom and fade out at the top
- [ ] Animations are smooth without jittering

### 3. Section-Specific Testing
- [ ] Hero section has white bubbles on blue background
- [ ] Advantages section has blue bubbles on white background
- [ ] CTA section has white bubbles on blue background
- [ ] Each section has approximately 18 bubbles

### 4. Responsive Behavior
- [ ] Bubbles adapt to different screen sizes
- [ ] Mobile performance is acceptable (no lag)
- [ ] Bubbles are visible on all device sizes

## Testing Steps

1. Remove the debugging styles from CSS (lines 39-41 in `.bubble-3d` class)
2. Refresh the webpage
3. Observe bubble appearance in each section
4. Check animation smoothness and drift patterns
5. Verify color schemes match the background context
6. Test on different screen sizes

## Expected Results

After implementing the fix:
- Bubbles will display with proper 3D glass effects
- Different color schemes will appear based on background
- Bubbles will have varied sizes and smooth animations
- Bubbles will appear in all three sections
- Performance will be smooth across all devices
