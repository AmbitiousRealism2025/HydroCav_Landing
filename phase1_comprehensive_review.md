    const formData = new FormData(event.target);
    const submission = {
        name: formData.get('name')?.trim(),
        email: formData.get('email')?.trim().toLowerCase(),
        company: formData.get('company')?.trim() || null,
        message: formData.get('message')?.trim(),
        user_agent: navigator.userAgent
    };
    
    // Working Supabase insertion
    const { data, error } = await supabaseClient
        .from('contact_submissions')

- **Modern Approaches:** ES6+ JavaScript features utilized effectively
- **Consistent Naming:** Variables and functions follow clear conventions
- **Working Integration:** Supabase client properly implemented and functional
- **Responsive CSS:** Modern Grid and Flexbox layouts implemented correctly

**Architectural Considerations:**
- **Current Approach:** Embedded JavaScript in HTML (functional but monolithic)
- **Maintainability:** Good for current scope, but modularization would improve scalability
- **Error Handling:** Basic implementation present, could be enhanced
- **Performance:** Good baseline with optimization opportunities

**Code Quality Examples:**

**Well-Implemented:**
```javascript
// Good: Proper async/await usage
const { data, error } = await supabaseClient
    .from('contact_submissions')
    .insert([submission]);

// Good: Proper error checking
if (!supabaseClient) {
    showErrorMessage('Unable to connect to server');
    return;
}
```

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
```javascript
// Current: Basic validation
const validation = validateFormData(submission);

// Recommended: Enhanced validation
function validateFormData(data) {
    const errors = [];
    
    if (!data.name || data.name.length < 2) {
        errors.push('Name must be at least 2 characters');
    }
    
    if (!data.email || !emailRegex.test(data.email)) {
        errors.push('Please enter a valid email address');
    }
    
    return { isValid: errors.length === 0, errors };
}
```

**Technical Debt Assessment:**
